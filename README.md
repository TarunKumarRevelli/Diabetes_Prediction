# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. The implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook file `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`. The dataset, preprocessing steps, and model training are all integrated to deliver predictions with measurable accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilizes Pandas for loading and analyzing the dataset.
- **Numerical Computations**: Employs NumPy for efficient numerical operations.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes feature scaling and dataset splitting for better model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures accuracy using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The notebook assumes the presence of a dataset related to diabetes. Ensure the dataset is in a format compatible with Pandas (e.g., CSV) and placed in the appropriate directory for loading.

## Steps to Run
1. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure the dataset file path is correctly specified in the code.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data will be scaled using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.
3. **Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
4. **Model Training**: SVM is trained on the processed data.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy is calculated and displayed.

## Key Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computation.
- **scikit-learn**:
  - `svm`: Support Vector Machine implementation.
  - `train_test_split`: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - `StandardScaler`: Standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
  - `accuracy_score`: Evaluating model performance.

## Results
The notebook includes the model's evaluation and accuracy score based on the test data. Results may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different machine learning models.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
- Add visualization of data distribution and model predictions.

## Disclaimer
Ensure proper preprocessing of the dataset, including handling missing values and outliers, as this is not included in the current implementation.
